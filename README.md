# How to use the licenses

This repository contains the licenses for the software or released by the Digital Transformation Team. Unless there are strong and explicit reasons to make an exception, this list also applies to the software developed on [Developers Italia](https://github.com/italia).

# Brief summary

To correctly apply a license, you must:

1. choose a license from those proposed here;
2. copy it to the repository root, named `LICENSE`
3. create and compile the `AUTHORS` file always in the root of the repository.

## How to choose the license

In particular, we suggest to use:

- [`EUPL-1.2`](EUPL-1.2) for all traditional software, native and mobile applications.
- [`AGPL-3.0-or-later`](AGPL-3.0-or-later) for all standalone software used over the network.
- [`BSD-3-Clause`](BSD-3-Clause) for software libraries
- [`CC-BY-4.0`](CC-BY-4.0) for documentation
- [`CC0-1.0`](CC0-1.0) for laws, schemas and other normative documents

## How to fill in the AUTHORS file

The `AUTHORS` file contains three information:

1. the **copyright holders**;
2. **moral rights holders**: are the names of the individual authors of the code, so as to recognize also their moral rights (which in Italian law are inalienable) regardless of the copyright holders; in the case of employees or other subordination regime, in fact, the copyright is the employer while the moral rights remain with the actual author;
3. the words "*The version control system provides attribution for specific lines of code*" for mapping the correspondences between authors and single portions of code.

It is not mandatory to add your name to the two lists; it is recommended only for relevant code contributions. All contributions are in any case tracked by the version control system, but they could be lost in case of distribution of the code outside of GitHub and moreover from the commit history alone it is not clear whether the author of the commit has the copyright or not. This is why we recommend the `AUTHORS` file to list the rights holders.

An example of the `AUTHORS` file [is available here](AUTHORS)

## Further steps

### AGPL-3.0-or-later
You need to create a `README` or` README.md` file that contains, at the bottom, the following text:

```
